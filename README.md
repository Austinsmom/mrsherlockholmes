[The Adventures of Mr. Sherlock Holmes](http://mrsherlockholmes.com) - A project by [Ian Devlin](http://twitter.com/iandevlin).

The simple aim of this site is to bring the written world of Sherlock Holmes to the browser, allowing the reader to enjoy the adventures of Sherlock Holmes in an easy, readable manner.

It uses basic HTML and CSS, using a mixture of [Typeplate](http://typeplate.com/) and [Typekit](https://typekit.com/) to deliver the typography.
